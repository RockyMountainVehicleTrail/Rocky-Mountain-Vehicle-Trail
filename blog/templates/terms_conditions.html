<h1>Terms</h1>
<p><b>Only legal use.</b>This is is intended only for legal purposes.  If it is illegal for you to access
this site you have no license to use and must stop immediately.</p>

<p><b>You must verify information before you go and take all legal responsibility for following all laws.</b>There are many laws and overlapping juristictions when you travel.  Places that were legal when I visited may not be legal at a different times. Most National Forests will have seasonal closures.  In addition, there may be burn bans, closures for animal breeding seasons, avalanche risk, unexploded artillery shells, hail, floods, snow, mud, rodents, wildlife etc.  You must check the safety and condition of any intended activities to ensure they are safe and legal before using any information on this site.  A good place to start is to contact US Forest Ranger Stations for the district you intend to visits, or the BLM field Office, or National Park Visitor Center.</p>

<p><b>No Warranty</b>All information on this site comes with no warranty express or implied.  You acknowledge that GPS data is inherent inacurrate.  In addition, much information has been compressed and therefore even more inaccurate than would be normally.  All information is also incomplete.  The site is based on information from my journeys across North America. Some of these trips were a long time ago and therefore the information may be inaccurate.  Stores, shops, gas stations, which were opened at one point may not be there any more.  Other places may have also opened since I was there.  I may have driven through some places or not visited them at all.  All information is my opinion also.</p>
