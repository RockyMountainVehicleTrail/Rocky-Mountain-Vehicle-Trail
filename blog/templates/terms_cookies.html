<h1>Cookie Policy for The Rocky Mountain Vehicle Trail</h1>

<p>This is the Cookie Policy for The Rocky Mountain Vehicle Trail, accessible from www.rmvtab.com</p>

<p><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></p>

<p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.</p>


<p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. </p>

<p><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></p>

<p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this).</p>

<p><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>
    <p>Site preferences cookies</p>
    <p>In order to provide you with a great experience on this site we provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember your preferences we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page that is affected by your preferences.  Cookies are only set to enable the map which may in turn set some other third party cookies.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></p>

<p>To load the interactive map on this website some cookies are used.  I have no control over those cookies and a lot of modern browsers will disable them by default.  Through my testing disabling third party cookies will not impact the functionality of the mapping portion of this site however I cannot stop The National Map from setting cookies on all browsers.  You can read the USGS Privacy Policies here <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/privacy-policies">USGS Privacy Policies</a></p>



<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site. This Cookies Policy was created with the help of the <a href="https://www.cookiepolicygenerator.com">Cookies Policy Template Generator</a> and the <a href="https://www.webterms.org">WebTerms Generator</a>.</p>
