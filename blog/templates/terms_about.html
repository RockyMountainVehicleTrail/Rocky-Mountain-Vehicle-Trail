<h1>About</h1>

<p>I made this website to help people plan there vacations learn about history or foreign languages.  Most of the information on this site I could not find presented in the manner I have on the internet.  I developed most of the information for my own personal use and decided to share it with the internet.</p>

<p>The information is incomplete as I have not been to some of these places in years so my recollection is not perfect.  I have been to everywhere listed or nearby and want to go back.  All views are my opinions.  I do quote some historic books but try to quote the source when possible.</p>

<p>I posted a lot of pictures along drives so that you can decide for yourself if any hike or drive is good.  I hope that I can help you have a better vacation.</p>
